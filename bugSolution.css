The solution involves understanding and adjusting the CSS specificity to achieve the desired style outcome.  There are several ways to address this:

**Option 1: More Specific Selector**

We can make the `div p` selector more specific by adding an ID selector to match the `div`, for example:

```css
#myDiv p {
  color: green; /* This will now take precedence over .special p */
}
```

**Option 2: Important Declaration (Less Recommended)**

We can add the `!important` flag to override other declarations, but generally this should be avoided due to potential maintainability issues.

```css
div p {
  color: green !important; 
}
```

**Option 3: CSS Preprocessor (Sass, Less, etc.)**

Use a CSS preprocessor to handle complex style management and avoid specificity-related issues through features like nesting and variables. 

Choose the best solution based on the project's context and complexity.
