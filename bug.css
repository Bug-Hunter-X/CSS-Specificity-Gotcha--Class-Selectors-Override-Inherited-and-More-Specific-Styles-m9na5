The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style will be overridden */
}

.special p {
  color: purple; /* This style will take precedence */
}

<div>
  <p class="special">This text will be purple.</p>
  <p>This text will be red.</p>
</div>
```

The unexpected behavior lies in the interaction between inheritance, specificity, and the class selector. Although `div p` has higher specificity than `p`, the `.special p` selector has even higher specificity due to the addition of the class selector, thus overriding the other styles.
